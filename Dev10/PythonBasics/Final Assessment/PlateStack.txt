Goal: Stack plates, one on top of another
    A larger plate cannot be placed on top of a smaller plate
    Plates are ordered from the largest at the bottom to the smallest at the top

    Plate "stack" is represented by a Python list
    Bottom plate is the first index
    The stack can grow to any size
    A plate is represented by a positive integer, which is the plates size

High Level Requirements:
    Add a plate:
        Add a plate to the top of the stack
        Print plates: Display the stack of plates in the terminal
        Remove plates: Remove 1-to-n plates from the top of the stack

Requirements:
    Add a plate:
        Add a plate to the top of the stack DONE
        Plates are represented by a positive integer DONe
        If the plate is less than or equal to zero, issue a warning and don't add the plate DONE

        If there are no plates on the stack, add it DONE

        The plate "below" must be greater than or equal to the current plate size
        If the current plate is too big, issue a warning and don't add the plate
        If not, add it to the top of the stack

    Print plates:
        Print plates to the terminal

        Plates should stack vertically, with the largest plate at the bottom and the smallest plate on the top

        If there are no plates, display a message

    Remove Plates:
        Remove a given number of plates from the top of the stack
        The value should be a positive integer DONE
        If the value is less than or equal to zero, issue a warning and don't remove any plates DONE

        If there are too many plates selected, issue a warning and don't remove any plates DONE?
        Otherwise, remove plates from the stack and print a message

Technical Requirements:
    Use a Python list to track plates

    Each menu item should be a function

    To collect positive integers from the user, convert the string value from the `input()` function to an integer using `int()`
