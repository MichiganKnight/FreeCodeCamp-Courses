    <br>
    <span class="color fw-bold" style="font-size: 15pt">Abstraction</span>

    <p><strong>Abstraction </strong>is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to
        the user.</p>
    <p>Another way, it shows only essential things to the user and hides the internal details, for example, sending SMS
        where you type the text and send the message. You don't know the internal processing about the message
        delivery.</p>
    <p>Abstraction lets you focus on what the object does instead of how it does it.</p>

    <span class="color fw-bold" style="font-size: 15pt">Generalization</span>

    <p><strong>Generalization </strong>is the process of extracting shared characteristics from two or more classes and
        combining them into a generalized superclass. Shared characteristics can be attributed, association, or methods.
    </p>

    <p>Eg: The classes <strong>Piece of Luggage</strong> and <strong>Piece of Cargo</strong> partially share the same
        attributes. From a domain perspective, the two classes are also very similar. During generalization, the shared
        characteristics are combined and used to create a new superclass <strong>Freight. Piece of Luggage</strong> and
        <strong>Piece of Cargo</strong> become subclasses of the class <strong>Freight.</strong> Therefore, the
        properties that are common to the classes <strong>Piece of Luggage</strong> and <strong>Piece of Cargo</strong>
        are placed in the superclass <strong>Freight</strong> - Identification, Weight, and ID-Number are those
        properties.</p>

    <span class="color fw-bold" style="font-size: 15pt">Specialization</span>

    <p><strong>Specialization</strong> means creating new subclasses from an existing class. If it turns out that
        certain attributes, associations, or methods only apply to some objects of the class, a subclass can be
        created.</p>

    <p>In the previous example of <strong>Generalization,</strong> we saw that the classes <strong>Piece of
        Luggage</strong> and <strong>Piece of Cargo</strong> shred similar properties that were placed in a superclass
        <strong>Freight.</strong> When it comes to <strong>Specialization,</strong> if there is a property that is only
        applicable to a specific subclass, such as <strong>Degree of Hazardousness,</strong> that property is placed in
        the class <strong>Piece of Cargo</strong> where-in this class also has all the properties of the
        <strong>Freight</strong> class with the concept of <strong>Generalization.</strong></p>

    <span class="color fw-bold" style="font-size: 15pt">Ways to Achieve Abstraction?</span>

    <p>There are two ways to achieve abstraction in Java</p>
    <div class="mx-auto" style="max-width: 800px">
        <ul class="text-start ps-4" style="list-style-type: square">
            <li>Abstract Class (0 to 100%)</li>
            <li><a class="color" href="/java/Interface.html>">Interface</a></li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <span class="color fw-bold" style="font-size: 15pt">Abstract Class</span>

    <p>A class which is declared as abstract is known as an <strong>abstract class.</strong> It can have abstract and
        non-abstract methods. It needs to be extended and its method implemented. It cannot be instantiated.</p>

    <span class="fw-semibold" style="font-size: 13pt">Some points to remember:</span>
    <div class="mx-auto" style="max-width: 800px">
        <ul class="text-start ps-4" style="list-style-type: square">
            <li>An abstract class must be declared with an abstract keyword</li>
            <li>It can have abstract and non-abstract methods</li>
            <li>It cannot be initialized</li>
            <li>It can have constructors and static methods also</li>
            <li>It can have final methods which will force the subclass not to change the body of the method</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <span class="color fw-bold" style="font-size: 15pt">Abstract Method</span>

    <p>A method which is declared abstract and does not have implementation is known as an abstract method</p>
    <div class="d-flex justify-content-center my-4">
        <div class="code-block" data-id="abstractMethod"
             data-src="/code/java/oop/pillars/abstraction/AbstractMethod.java"></div>
    </div>

    <div class="mx-auto" style="max-width: 800px">
        <ul class="text-start ps-4" style="list-style-type: square">
            <li>To create an abstract class called <strong>Bank</strong></li>
            <li>To create an abstract method called <strong><code>getRateOfInterest()</code></strong></li>
            <li>To create two subclasses called <strong>SBI - 7%</strong> and <strong>PNB - 5%</strong> as two banks
                that extend the abstract class <strong>Bank</strong></li>
            <li>To implement different functionalities for the <strong><code>getRateOfInterest()</code></strong> method
                in the SBI and PNB classes through the concept of method overriding and print out the interest rate
                inside the <strong><code>main()</code></strong> method created separately in a test class called
                <strong>TestBank</strong>
            </li>
