        <ul class="text-start ps-4" style="list-style-type: square">
            <li>Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. The most common use of polymorphism in
                OOP occurs when a parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object.
            </li>
            <li>Any Java object that can pass more than one IS-A test is considered to be polymorphic. In Java, all Java
                objects are polymorphic since any object will pass the IS-A test for their own type and for the class
                Object.
            </li>

    <span class="color fw-bold" style="font-size: 15pt">Method Overloading</span>

    <div class="mx-auto" style="max-width: 800px">
        <ul class="text-start ps-4" style="list-style-type: square">
            <li>If a class has multiple methods having the same name but different parameters, it is known as <strong>Method
                Overloading.</strong></li>
            <li>If we have to perform only one operation, having the same name of the methods increases the readability
                of the program.
            </li>
            <li>Suppose you have to perform addition of the given numbers but there can be any number of arguments, if
                you write the method such as <code>a(int, int)</code> for two parameters, and <code>b(int, int,
                    int)</code> for three parameters then it may be challenging for you as well as other programmers to
                understand the behavior of the method because its name differs.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <span class="color fw-bold" style="font-size: 15pt">Different ways to overload a method?</span>

    <p>These are two ways to overload the method in Java</p>
    <div class="mx-auto" style="max-width: 800px">
        <ul class="text-start ps-4" style="list-style-type: square">
            <li>By changing the number of arguments</li>
            <li>By changing the data type</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <span class="color fw-bold" style="font-size: 15pt">Method Overloading - Changing the Number of Arguments</span>

    <div class="d-flex justify-content-center my-4">
        <div class="code-block" data-id="methodOverloading" data-src="/code/java/oop/pillars/polymorphism/MethodOverloading.java"></div>
    </div>

    <p>In the above example, we have created two methods, the first <code>add()</code> method performs addition of two
        numbers and second the second <code>add()</code> method performs addition of three numbers.</p>

    <p>In the above example, we are creating <strong>static methods so that we don't need to create an instance for
        calling methods.</strong></p>

    <span class="color fw-bold" style="font-size: 15pt">Method Overloading - Changing Data Type of Arguments</span>

    <div class="d-flex justify-content-center my-4">
        <div class="code-block" data-id="methodOverloading2" data-src="/code/java/oop/pillars/polymorphism/MethodOverloading2.java"></div>
    </div>

    <p>In the above example, we have created two methods that differ in data type. The first <code>add()</code> method
        receives two integer arguments and second <code>add()</code> method receives two double arguments.</p>

    <p><strong>Note: Method overloading is not possible by changing the return type of the method.</strong></p>

    <span class="color fw-bold" style="font-size: 15pt">Overloading the <code>main()</code> Method in Java</span>

    <div class="d-flex justify-content-center my-4">
        <div class="code-block" data-id="overloadingMain" data-src="/code/java/oop/pillars/polymorphism/OverloadingMain.java"></div>
    </div>

    <p>Yes, by method overloading, you can have any number of main methods in a class by method overloading. But JVM
        calls <code>main()</code> method which receives a string array as arguments only.</p>

    <span class="color fw-bold" style="font-size: 15pt">Method Overriding</span>

    <div class="mx-auto" style="max-width: 800px">
        <ul class="text-start ps-4" style="list-style-type: square">
            <li>If a subclass (child class) has the same method as declared in the parent class, it is known as <strong>method
                overriding in Java.</strong></li>
            <li>In other words, if a subclass provides the specific implementation of the method that has been declared
                by one of its parent classes, it is known as method overriding.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <span class="color fw-bold" style="font-size: 15pt">Usage and Rules for Method Overriding</span>

    <p>Usage:</p>

    <div class="mx-auto" style="max-width: 800px">
        <ul class="text-start ps-4" style="list-style-type: square">
            <li>Method overriding is used to provide the specific implementation of a method which is already provided
                by its superclass.
            </li>
            <li>Method overriding is used for runtime polymorphism</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <p>Rules:</p>

    <div class="mx-auto" style="max-width: 800px">
        <ul class="text-start ps-4" style="list-style-type: square">
            <li>The method must have the same name as its parent class</li>
            <li>The method must have the same parameter as in the parent class</li>
            <li>There must be an IS-A relationship (inheritance)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="mx-auto" style="max-width: 800px">
        <ul class="text-start ps-4" style="list-style-type: square">
            <li>If a subclass (child class) has the same method as declared in the parent class, it is known as <strong>method
                overriding in Java.</strong></li>
            <li>In other words, if a subclass provides the specific implementation of the method that has been declared
                by one of its parent classes, it is known as method overriding.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <span class="color fw-bold" style="font-size: 15pt">Example for Method Overriding</span>

    <div class="d-flex justify-content-center my-4">
        <div class="code-block" data-id="methodOverriding" data-src="/code/java/oop/pillars/polymorphism/MethodOverriding.java"></div>
    </div>

    <p>In the above example, we have defined the <code>disp()</code> method in the subclass as defined in the parent
        class, but it has some specific implementation. The name and parameter list of the methods are the same, and
        there is IS-A relationship between the classes.</p>

    <span class="color fw-bold" style="font-size: 15pt">Can a static method be overridden?</span>

    <p>No, a static method cannot be overridden. It can be proved by runtime polymorphism, so we will learn it
        later.</p>
    <p>It is because the static method is bound with a class, whereas the instance method is bound with an object.
        Static belongs to the class area, and an instance belongs to the heap area.</p>

    <span class="color fw-bold" style="font-size: 15pt">Method Overloading vs Method Overriding</span>

    <p><strong>Method Overloading:</strong></p>
    <div class="mx-auto" style="max-width: 800px">
        <ul class="text-start ps-4" style="list-style-type: square">
            <li>Method overloading is used to increase the readability of the program</li>
            <li>Method overloading is performed within a class</li>
            <li>In the case of method overloading, the parameter must be different</li>
            <li>Method overloading is the example of compile timy polymorphism</li>
            <li>In Java, method overloading can't be performed by changing a return type of the method only. Return type
                can be the same or different in method overloading. But you must have to change the parameter.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <p><strong>Method Overriding:</strong></p>
    <div class="mx-auto" style="max-width: 800px">
        <ul class="text-start ps-4" style="list-style-type: square">
            <li>Method overriding is used to provide the specific implementation of the method that is already provided
                by its super class
            </li>
            <li>Method overriding occurs in two classes that have IS-A (inheritance) relationship</li>
            <li>In case of method overriding, any parameters must be the same</li>
            <li>Method overriding is the example of run time polymorphism</li>
            <li>The return type must be the same or covariant method overriding</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <span class="color fw-bold" style="font-size: 15pt">Sample Exercise</span>

    <p>Consider a scenario where Bank is a class that provides functionality to get the rate of interest. However, the
        rate of interest varies according to banks. For example, SBI, ICIC, and AXIS banks could provide 8%, 7%, and 9%
        of interest.</p>
    <p>Go ahead and code the above scenario.</p>
