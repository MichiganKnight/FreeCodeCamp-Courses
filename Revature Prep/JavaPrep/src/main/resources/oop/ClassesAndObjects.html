    <br>
    <span class="color fw-bold" style="font-size: 15pt">Object</span>

    <p>Any entity that has state and behavior is known as an object. For example, a chair, pen, table, keyboard, bike,
        etc... It can be physical or logical.</p>
    <p>An object can be defined as an instance of a class. An object contains an address and takes up space in memory.
        Objects can communicate without knowing the details of each other's data or code. The only necessary thing is
        the type of message accepted and the type of response returned by the objects.</p>
    <p><strong>Example: </strong>A dog is an object because it has states like color, name, breed, etc... as well as
        behaviors like wagging the tail, barking, eating, etc...</p>

    <span class="color fw-bold" style="font-size: 15pt">Class</span>

    <p>A <strong>class, </strong>in the context of <strong>Java, </strong>are templates that are used to create objects
        and to <strong>define </strong>object data types and methods. Core properties include the data types and methods
        that may be used by the object.</p>

    <p>A class can also be defined as a blueprint from which you can create an individual object. Class doesn't consume
        any space.</p>

    <div class="mx-auto" style="max-width: 800px">
        <ul class="text-start ps-4" style="list-style-type: square">
            <li>OOPs make development and maintenance easier, whereas in a procedure-oriented programming language it is
                not easy to manage if code grows as project size increases
            </li>
            <li>OOPs provide data hiding, whereas in a procedure-oriented programming language, global data can be
                accessed from anywhere.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="d-flex justify-content-center my-4">
        <div class="code-block" data-id="classesAndObjects" data-src="/code/java/oop/classesandobjects/Dog.java"></div>
    </div>

    <p>A class is a blueprint from which individual objects are created.</p>
    <p>The code above is a sample of a class <strong>Dog </strong>with attributes and behavior.</p>
